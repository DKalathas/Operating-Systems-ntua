# Operating Systems - NTUA (2019-2020)

This repository includes the solutions of the 4 lab exercises for ECE/NTUA course "Operating Systems" in academic year 2019-2020.


## First Lab (fork)

We focused on understanding how to fork processes and access files.

## Second Lab (signals)

We used signals (through terminal, or between processes).

## Third Lab (pipes)

We used pipes for message transferring between processes.

## Fourth Lab (sockets)

We focused on understanding how server-client connection works. We used sockets and implemented a client process, which communicated with a certain server.
